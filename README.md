## Project 1: Stochastic Optimal Control

### Description

This assignment focuses on implementing a stochastic optimal control system to simulate the reaching movement of a patient. The project folder contains the problem sheet, the submitted code, and the detailed report.

### Installation

To set up the environment for Project 1, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AcaAac/Neuroscience-EPL.git

# Navigate to the Project1 directory
cd Neuroscience/Project1

# Access the submitted code
P1_V8.ipynb


```

## Problem Sheet
```bash
cd Neuroscience-EPL/Project1/Project_1_Stochastic_Optimal_Control
```

### Report
